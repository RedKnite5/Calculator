# ReCalc
This is a graphing calculator written in python. 

To run this program you will need python 3.6, Sympy, Pillow, docopt,
and tkinter. It will work without these, but certain functionality will be limited.

I have tested it on Windows 10 and Fedora 26-27. It will not necessarily work on other operating systems.
